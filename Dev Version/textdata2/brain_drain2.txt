As with other human migration, the social environment is considered to be a key reason for this population shift. 
In source countries, lack of opportunities, political instability or oppression, 
economic depression, health risks and more contribute to brain drain, 
whereas host countries usually offer rich opportunities, political stability and freedom, 
a developed economy and better living conditions that attract talent. 
At the individual level, family influences (relatives living overseas, for example), 
as well as personal preferences, career ambitions and other motivating factors can be considered.
Talent plays an important role in helping a country develop. 
The economy of a country that has a large number of world-class scientists and technicians 
can be more innovative than those of others that do not.
Different areas and nations have distinct policies 
to retain skilled workers due to the different national or regional situation. 
For instance, in African countries, the health systems have been severely affected by brain drain, 
so various measures have been suggested and tried to limit the migration of health workers to rich countries. 
In Kuwait, people have argued that the country should cultivate a sense of security and hope 
among the elite to curb brain drain because people are not so confident of their country's future.
China tries to create a normal and free atmosphere and mechanism that would help talents flourish.
And in India, although suffering severe brain drain every year, 
the Indian government has not adopted strict policies 
because they believe that the overseas talent will eventually contribute to the nation in the future.
Germany established a government-funded initiative called GAIN to assist 
Germans working abroad to return to their home country. 
Other European countries have similar initiatives.
