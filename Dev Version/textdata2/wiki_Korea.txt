In 1945, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed on the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea 
in the aftermath of World War II, leaving Korea partitioned 
along the 38th parallel, with the North under Soviet occupation 
and the south under U.S. occupation. These circumstances soon became the basis for the division of Korea 
by the two superpowers, exacerbated by their inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence.
The Communist-inspired government in the North received backing from the Soviet Union 
in opposition to the pro-Western government in the South, 
leading to Korea's division into two political entities: North Korea and South Korea.
This eventually led to war in 1950, which became the Korean War.
The war did not produce a formalized peace treaty, 
a factor that contributes to the high tensions which continue to divide the peninsula.
South Korea ranks second on math and literature and first in problem solving.
Although South Korean students often rank high on international comparative assessments, 
the education system is criticised for emphasising too much upon passive learning and memorization. 
The South Korean education system is rather notably strict and structured 
as compared to its counterparts in most Western societies. 
Also, the prevalence of non-school for-profit private institutes such as academies or cram schools, 
which too emphasise passive memorisation, as opposed to conceptual understanding, 
in students are criticised as a major social problem. After students enter university, 
however, the situation is markedly reversed In Korea, university is hard to enter, 
and graduation is comparatively easier than entry.
