Walking along the street, I met a friend of mine.
Hearing the fire bell, he jumped out of bed.
Turning to the left, you will find the post office.
Living with such people, you will be enjoy your life fully.
Not knowing his address, I could not write to him.
Having nothing to do, we went to bed early.
Admitting what he says, I still think him to be wrong.
Granting his honesty, we can’t employ him.
He sat down, and he faced the blackboard.
Opening the drawer, he took out a paper knife.
Listening to the story, she had breakfast.
Shivering with cold, the beggar walked about.
Having done my task, I have nothing more to do.
Never having seen him before, we didn’t know who he was.
The moon having risen, we came down the hill.
Looking pale, the boy examined by the doctor carefully.
Compared with her sister, she is not pretty.
Having been deceived so often, I’m now on my guard.
School being over,
The work having finished, she went shopping.
All things considered, his demand for higher wages is reasonable.
Don’t speak with your mouth full.
He sat motionless with her back resting against the wall.
We felt quite free with our work finished.
Working as she did at the factory, Jane took an industrial disease.
Standing as it does on the hill,
Living as I do remote from the town,
Being as he is handsome,
Respected as he was by all,
Written, as it is, in an easy style,
