Human capital flight is an Economics term equivalent to the Sociology term, brain drain,
which refers to the emigration of intelligent, well-educated individuals to somewhere for better pay or conditions,
causing the place they came from to experience the loss of those skilled people, or "brains."
Typically, emigrating brains have learned English and move to the United States or some other English-speaking country.
An example is Albert Einstein. Brain drain is common in developing nations,
particularly in many former African colonies of England, the island nations of the Caribbean,
and in centralized economies such as the former East Germany and the Soviet Union.
China and India have recently been discovered to be at the top of the list of countries with skilled students of English leaving.
There are several types of brain drain:
Organizational:
The flight of talented, creative, and highly trained employees from large corporations
that occurs when employees perceive the direction and leadership of the company to be unstable or stagnant,
and thus, unable to keep up with their personal and professional ambitions.
Geographical:
The flight of highly trained individuals and college graduates from their area of residence,
for instance, those migrating from the mid-western United States to the coastal states and large metropolises.
Industrial:
The movement of traditionally skilled workers from one sector of an industry to another.
For example, jobs in the United States and other governments, also known as the public sector,
have experienced significant generational brain drain as tenured boomer generation employees retire.
Heightened competition for talent from the private sector and budgetary constraints
have made it increasingly difficult to attract replacements for these retirees.
