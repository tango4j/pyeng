Capitalism is an economic system and a mode of production in which 
trade, industries, and the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned. 
Private firms and proprietorships usually operate in order to generate profit, 
but may operate as private nonprofit organizations.
Central characteristics of capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labour 
and, in some situations, fully competitive markets.
In a capitalist economy, the parties to a transaction typically determine the prices at which they exchange assets, goods, and services.
The degree of competition, the role of intervention and regulation, 
and the scope of state ownership vary across different models of capitalism.
Economists, political economists, and historians have adopted different perspectives 
in their analyses of capitalism and have recognized various forms of it in practice. 
These include laissez-faire or free market capitalism, welfare capitalism, crony capitalism, corporatism, "third way" social democracy and state capitalism. 
Each model has employed varying degrees of dependency on free markets, public ownership, obstacles to free competition, and inclusion of state-sanctioned social policies.
The extent to which different markets are free, as well as the rules defining private property, 
become matters of politics and of policy. Many states have a mixed economy, 
which combines elements of both capitalism and centrally planned economics.
Capitalism has existed under many forms of government, in many different times, places, and cultures.
Following the decline of feudalism, mixed capitalist systems became dominant in the Western world and continue to spread.
